## Features

By clicking the middle mouse button on any block-related items such as block icons, document tree items, bookmarks, etc., a small window opens at the mouse location for editing or viewing the content of the corresponding block.

## Disclaimer

This plugin is a secondary development based on the "Webview" plugin, specifically extracting and encapsulating the middle-click popup window feature from the original plugin.
